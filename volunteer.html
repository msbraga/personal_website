                <h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: lighter; text-decoration: underline;">SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil: March to December 2019</h3>
                <p>During my senior year of high school I started volunteering in a community school that was partnered
                    with my school at the time. There I started as a librarian assistant. I would read books to kids in 
                    first grade every week, in order to inspire them to read and then help them choose a book of their 
                    own to take home. During this time is when I started conneting with the kids, which was when I received 
                    this drawing from one of the kids. <br>Later that year I got promoted to teacher assistant, transfering 
                    from the library to the classroom.
